Goal: Get your code bug free within one workday while also dealing with  distractions.

To fix your code, click and hold on an erroneous line until the bar fills up. Don’t forget to use the scroll bar!

Distractions are inevitable so you should take care of any before things are irreparable.

To deal with distractions, click and hold until they are resolved — momentarily. (Some things need an item to be fixed).

The more bugs you find and the better you keep things in order, the higher your score will be. Good luck!
